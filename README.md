# Echo Code ‚Äî AI-Assisted Python Debugging for Visually Impaired Programmers

**Echo Code** is a Visual Studio Code extension that combines **AI-powered code tutoring** with **audible Python error reporting**. Designed to assist **visually impaired students**, this tool reads out Python errors detected by **Pylint**, provides inline code annotations, and offers an interactive chat tutor that analyzes your active file to answer questions and provide exercises.

---

## **Features**

- **Automatic Python Error Detection**  
  Automatically detects errors using Pylint when a Python file is saved.

- **Reads Critical Errors Aloud**  
  Uses text-to-speech to read only essential errors (e.g., syntax errors, undefined variables).

- **Output Panel Logging**  
  Displays all detected errors in the VS Code Output Panel for visual reference.

- **Simplified Error Messages**  
  Provides clear, concise explanations without overwhelming beginners.

- **Summarize Functions and Classes**  
  Automatically generates brief summaries for functions and classes using AI, delivered via text-to-speech (TTS).

- **AI Code Tutoring Annotations**  
  Provides inline annotations explaining **common coding mistakes** and suggesting improvements.
  - üÜï New functions for generating big O(n) annotations

- **Interactive Chat Tutor**  
  An AI-powered tutor that reads your active file and answers questions or provides exercises specific to its content. Open it with `Ctrl+Alt+C` and ask about your code directly.

- **Voice Input for Tutor Chat**  
  Use your microphone to ask questions instead of typing them. Trigger voice input with a shortcut or mic button in the chat panel.

- **Auto-Detection of Missing Tools**  
  Automatically prompts users to install **Pylint** if it‚Äôs not found.

- **Function Navigation via Hotkeys**  
  Use **Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down Arrow** to navigate between function definitions, with automatic speech announcing the current function.
  
- **Assignment Tracker System**   
  Allows blind users to upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` assignment files and uses AI to extract clear task lists:
  - Tasks are read aloud one-by-one.
  - Tasks can be marked complete with a hotkey.
  - Tasks are saved to a file and displayed in the output panel.

 - **Integration with GitHub Copilot**  
 Leverages GitHub Copilot for additional AI-powered coding assistance.

- **Integration with GitHub Copilot**  
  Leverages GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat for enhanced AI-powered coding assistance.

## **How to Use**

### **Navigating Functions**
- Press **Ctrl+Alt+Down Arrow** to move to the next function in descending order.
- Press **Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow** to move to the previous function in ascending order.

### **Summarizing Code**
- To hear a brief summary of the current Python class: Press **Ctrl+Alt+Space C**.
- To hear a brief summary of the current Python function: Press **Ctrl+Alt+Space F**.

### **Using the Chat Tutor**
